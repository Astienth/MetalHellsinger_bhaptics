# Configuration

The first time you launch the game with the mod, a configuration file is created at **\Metal Hellsinger\BepInEx\config\org.bepinex.plugins.MetalHellsinger_bhaptics.cfg**
If you wanna play left handed, change this file content to "**leftHanded = true**".
The same config exists within the vr mod, adjust accordingly.
